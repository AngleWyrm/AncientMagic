  <description>This mod makes magic and technology drink from the same cup. Where technology is low are the places of great magic, and where technology is high magic is as common as Jedi knights.

Neolithic tribals gain magic as an ally, and Spacer clans have less to do with it. All technology levels are present, going from pre-neolithic Animal to post-spacer Ultra.

Installation: Place this add-on mod AFTER/BENEATH Infused mod.

Release Version 17.4.15</description>
